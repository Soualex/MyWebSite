MyWebSite
=========

This is the Soualex's Web site

It is a very basic site developed to learn the language PHP. This site respects the standard MVC however it was modified a little because the controllers and the views have been regrouped in a directory called "module".

This site is not under development anymore because I develop a Web sites' Framework at the moment. You can find that on my GitHub page (https://github.com/Soualex/MyFramework).
